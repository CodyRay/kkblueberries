        <h1>About Our Farm</h1>
        <p>
          We have 20 acres of Dukes;  an early, large, easy to pick variety. Our season typically runs mid June to mid July (depending on the weather). K {'&'} K Blueberry Farm is <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/ODA/CID/ghp_gap.shtml" target="_blank">GAP certified</a>, and we water and fertilize through the drip line to limit contact with the berries themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parking is located on both sides of the driveway-heading in towards the bushes. We do flag our grass sprinklers and ask our customers look out for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have portable toilets and a hand washing station available for our customers.
        </p>

          <li>
            We have large and small buckets available to pick into, or you may bring your own. Stop by the shed to weigh your bucket and get a row assignment. If you are picking into our buckets, be sure to bring a container to take them home in.

            Cash is preferred but checks are accepted with ID. No credit/debit accepted.

        <h2>Which blueberries should I pick?</h2>
        <p>
          Green berries will not ripen once picked. Please pick only the ripe berries and leave the green ones on the bushes to ripen later. Ripe blueberries are plump, deeply colored, and “give” easy.
        </p>
        <h2>When are you open?</h2>
        <p>
          We close mid-day from 11am to 5pm because when the temperature rises the berries become too soft for picking. We may also close on days with high temperature. The quickest way to get updates on picking is to call the phone number for information before you drive out here.
        </p>
        <h2>How long do blueberries last?</h2>
        <p>
          Blueberries are perishable, avoid leaving them in a hot car and keep them out of direct sunlight. For the longest lasting fresh blueberries, don't rinse the berries until right before serving. Blueberries will keep fresh in a refrigerator for 10 to 14 days and frozen blueberries will last one year in a freezer (at 0 degrees or colder).
        </p>
        <h2>What is the best way to freeze blueberries?</h2>
        <p>
          Don't wash your blueberries before freezing; the secret to successful freezing is to have berries completely dry before freezing. For loose packed berries, spread on a cookie sheet in a single layer and place in the freezer until hard, about 1-2 hours. Transfer to freezer bags and store up to a year at 0 degrees or colder. Also consider vacuum sealing the frozen blueberries to help preserve the blueberries.
