//     K {'&'} K Blueberries has <strong>closed for the 2021 season</strong>. ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ I want to thank all the people who came out during this short, hot blueberry season. You supported my small business, got outside with your family and friends, and went home with some delicious blueberries. It was a great season made better for seeing all of you! ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ. Remember to start looking around Father's Day on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/K-and-K-Blueberries-104303779663777/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page</a> - it's when I get a good idea of when I will be able to open. See you next year! Kathy
