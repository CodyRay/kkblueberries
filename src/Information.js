        <h1>Which blueberries should I pick?</h1>
        <p>
          Green berries will not ripen once picked. Please pick only the ripe berries and leave the green ones on the bushes to ripen later. Ripe blueberries are plump, deeply colored, and “give” easy.
        </p>
        <h1>When are you open?</h1>
        <p>
          We close mid-day from 11am to 5pm because when the temperature rises the berries become too soft for picking. We may also close on days with high temperature. The quickest way to get updates on picking is to call the phone number for information before you drive out here.
        </p>
        <h1>How long do blueberries last?</h1>
        <p>
          Blueberries are perishable, avoid leaving them in a hot car and keep them out of direct sunlight. For the longest lasting fresh blueberries, don't rinse the berries until right before serving. Blueberries will keep fresh in a refrigerator for 10 to 14 days and frozen blueberries will last one year in a freezer (at 0 degrees or colder).
        </p>
        <h1>What is the best way to freeze blueberries?</h1>
        <p>
          Don't wash your blueberries before freezing; the secret to successful freezing is to have berries completely dry before freezing. For loose packed berries, spread on a cookie sheet in a single layer and place in the freezer until hard, about 1-2 hours. Transfer to freezer bags and store up to a year at 0 degrees or colder. Also consider vacuum sealing the frozen blueberries to help preserve the blueberries.
